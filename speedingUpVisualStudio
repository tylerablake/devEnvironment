This is a list of all the performance enhancements I do to Visual Studio to get my machine ready for development using Visual Studio.





This list contains changes I've found but haven't tried yet.
Disable F1. (Environment->Keyboard) This is probably the best advice that I found somewhere.
Disable "Animate environment tools" (Environment->General).
Disable Start Page (Environment->Startup).
Disable "Track Active Item in Solution Explorer" (Projects and Solutions).
Disable Navigation Bar (Text Editor->C#). I think this is available for every language.
Set "AutoToolboxPopulate" to false (Windows Forms Designer).
You can set the Code view as the default view when viewing Windows Forms. Just right-click on the cs file and select "Open With...".
Open Visual Studio using the command line (devenv) rather than using the Start menu. I don't know why but I notice it loads faster.
Turn off Track Changes. (Text Editor->Track changes)






Speeding up ReSharper
Turn off Solution-Wide Analysis
Disable context actions
  In ReSharper options, go to Code Editing | Context Actions and Code Editing | [Language] | Context Actions, and uncheck the actions that are less helpful to you
Speed up typing
  If you experience slowdown while typing, you can turn off member signatures under ReSharper | Options | IntelliSense | Completion Appearance:
  If this doesnâ€™t help, switch back to built-in Visual Studio IntelliSense under ReSharper | Options | Environment | IntelliSense | General:
Disable formatting
  To speed up typing, you can also disable auto-format options under ReSharper | Options | Environment | General to avoid code formatting while typing:
Disable unit testing
  If you don't use the ReSharper unit test runner, you can save some processing time by turning it off. Go to ReSharper | Options | Tools | Unit Testing and clear the corresponding check-box.
Disable the navigation bar
  If you use the File Structure window, then you probably don't use the navigation bar on top of the editor. If so, you can disable it by unchecking the corresponding check-box in Tools | Options | Text Editor | C#.
Speed up editor scrolling
  The problem with editor scrolling arises due to hardware-accelerated editor rendering. If you experience this, try turning off the following options under Tools | Options | Environment | General:
    Automatically adjust visual experience based on client performance
    Use hardware graphics acceleration if available
Save time on startup
  Turning off the start page and the news channel might save some time on startup. To do so, go to Tools | Options | Environment and choose to show empty environment at startup.
Disable unused extensions
  Go to Tools | Extension Manager, go through the list and check if you really need each of them. You can uninstall or disable the unused ones.









Parallels Desktop for Mac

If you're running Visual Studio in a Windows virtual machine on your Mac using Parallels Desktop, ReSharper IntelliSense lists might be very slow to render.

If this occurs in your setup, consider switching from Coherence mode to Full Screen mode. For guidelines on switching between the two modes, please see this Parallels Knowledge Base entry.
