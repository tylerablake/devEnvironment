This is a list of custom Visual Studio keybinds I use, and how you set them up.

How to set them up

To set them up, go to : Tools > Options > Environment > Keybind.

Then type the "VS Command" into the "Show Commands Containing:" textbox.
Select the command you want to modify binds for.
Then "Remove" the current binding for the command.(Optional, also, there might be multiple binds for 1 command.)
Then click inside the "Press Shortcut Keys' text box and hit your preferred shortcut keys.
Then click "Assign"
Then click "Ok"
